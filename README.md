Book Recommendations
====================

People have asked me for book recommendations, so I decided to write it down here.  As a disclaimer, I would like to say that I am probably a terrible person to get book recommendations from just because of how few books I actually get to read.  Read at your own discretion.

## When do I Read a Book?

I am an extremely slow reader, so I don't normally read many books.  On average, I can probably claim victory over 2 to 3 books per year.  Because of this, I am extremely careful about what books I end up reading.  I want to make sure that they're worth my time investment digging into them.  The usual way that I go about deciding to read a book is if multiple people have recommended it to me multiple times.

> Isn't this a terrible way to choose how to read books?

Yes.  I would not recommend this at all.  I consider this a terrible habit of mine which I am actively working towards dissolving.  The alternative though is getting better at reading, another thing I'm working on.

> Couldn't you just stop reading a book if you didn't like it?

Sure, but I am also obsessive about finishing things I've started.

Anyways, because of this, it means that I often pass on reading books that look like they wouldn't teach me something new even though they sound like they strongly align with my values/ethic/ideals/etc...

So below I have two lists; one of books I've actually read and strongly recommend, and another of books that have been strongly recommended to me but I haven't read because I doubt I would get much new information from them.

## Books I've Read and Strongly Recommend

[Getting More by Stuart Diamond](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-More-Persuasive-Person-Work/dp/0307716902)

Nearly every negotiating book out there that I've come across of is pretty much a guide on how to trick people, which is extremely disappointing.  Getting More is the first and only book I've seen that teaches you how to negotiate at work and in life in a way that fosters relationships with everyone involved and leads to long term success with the added bonus of making you feel good inside cause you made both your and someone else's life better.

[Lauren Ipsum by Carlos Bueno](https://www.amazon.com/Lauren-Ipsum-Computer-Science-Improbable-ebook/dp/B00QL616IC)

This is a children's story that tricks you into learning concepts about computer science.  At the end of the day, it's a great story that holds it's own, but if you're a computer scientist, you read through the book giggling at yourself at every page as you realize that Lauren is inadvertently learning about heuristics, algorithms, and engineering design through her journey.  I love this book so much I carried an extra copy with me for two years just so that I could gift it to people when I talked to them immediately.

[The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897)

I love this book because it gives you so much context.  Camille describes the responsibilities and expectations of an engineer at every stage of the career ladder, from new college graduate, senior engineer, tech lead, manager, manager of managers, a VP or director, to finally, a CTO.  Seeing all the roles in that order gives you a lot of insight on your relationship and struggle with your peers as well as your manager and their relationship and struggles with their peers and their manager.

[The E-Myth by Michael E. Gerber](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/)

This is an old book that has little to do with engineering and more to do with starting and building a business.  It talks about the general follies that people make when trying to start their own business, as well as introduces interesting paradigms of roles that different individuals perform within a business (entrepreneur, manager, and technician).  It does this through a series of case studies performed by a consulting agency helping small businesses that are on a brink of collapse.

[Lies My Teacher Told Me by James W. Loewen](https://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/0743296281/)

This book is about American history and how all American history textbooks are utterly wrong.  It's amazing enough to just learn about the true history of America (as far as we know from primary sources), but Loewen also explains the political climate that got American history books to be the way they are.  A lot of us are pretty familiar with some common myths like how Columbus did not actually discover America, but this book goes waaaaaay further than that.  It's an amazing read, extremely enlightening, and also humbling.  We're very quick to condemn other countries for flourishing their history books taught in their schools, but we pretty much do the same thing.

[Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse](https://www.amazon.com/Siddhartha-Hermann-Hesse/dp/1420951483/)

This is a story about a monk's search for spiritual enlightenment and the opportunities that come to him in that journey.  I don't read many spiritual books, but this one has a pretty good story and lots of lessons learned along the way.  In particular, this book made me appreciate the power of _waiting_.  It's also filled with amazingly [thought-provoking dialogue like this one](https://gist.github.com/mdayaram/49ae99ab26ba326f0ae44883339b60db) which I'm a sucker for.

[Predictably Irrational by Dr. Dan Ariely](https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248/)

This is an oldie but a goodie.  A series of studies explaining how, in certain conditions, humans will behave in irrational ways.  This should not be new, we all know that humans are extremely irrational, but this is probably the first time I've seen that irrationality studied so thoroughly.

[Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder](https://www.amazon.com/Sophies-World-History-Philosophy-Classics/dp/0374530718/)

A good story that teaches you the history of western philosophy to date through the eyes of Sophie.  In general, I love philosophy, but it's often hard to digest.  This book makes it approachable and understandable without watering it down so much.  It also does a great job at providing historical context of certain ideologies.  We often forget that things like Pluto's Republic and other philosophical doctrines were a response to a specific problem facing society at that time.  Knowing what society at that time was helps tremendously in understanding what problems these philosophers wanted to solve.

[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/)

This is also an oldie but a goodie.  Great study of great design that you probably barely notice.  The whole idea of how "a door should tell you just by looking at it whether it needs to be pulled or pushed" came from this book.
